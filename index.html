    <H1>Twitter Sentiment Analysis on the Alabama Election</H1>

    <p> This was a homework assignment we had in our Data Analytics class where we create a twitter bot that looked at user sentiment on a specific topic. I chose to run my specific analysis on the Alabama Special Election on December 12, 2017. It was a heated race between a controversial Republican, Roy Moore, and Democrat, Doug Jones.

        I ran my twitter sentiment analysis after the election results were announced for the following news twitter handles @bbcnews, @cbsnews, @cnn,
        @foxnews, and @nytimes. After the results were announced that Doug Jones won, it was clear to see the bias that each website had. Fox clearly had a negative sentiment on their tweets. CNN and CBS were overwhelmingly positive. BBC and NYTimes were rather neutral.
